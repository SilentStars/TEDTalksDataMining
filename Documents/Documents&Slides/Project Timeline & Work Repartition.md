#### 1. Develop a Development Plan

> Tasks :

- Decide the dataset and find out the contxet and background.
- Discuss what kind of application should we develop.
- Draw class diagram and sequence diagram for the application.

#### 3. Build a Web Page Background

> Tasks：

- Define the overall structure of the project and how to store the data.
- Write the necessary database.
- Write a background handler and give the interface.

> Risks:

- The design of 'User' database need to think seriously.

#### 4. Build a Web Page Front-end

> Tasks：

- Draw the prototype of GUI using Axure. 
- Learn React & Write user interface using React.
- Use interface to request data from background & Make data visualization.

|                            Tasks                             |         Member          |    Time     | Finished |
